# echoVault-blockchain

EchoVault is a decentralized financial platform designed to help users manage their finances responsibly. We aim to disrupt the traditional credit scoring system and improve financial literacy. We recognise the current credit score system's lack of transparency and flexibility. We are developing a new modern system to access loans and financial services without the attachment of traditional banks.

Key Features:
- Wallet Creation:
  + New wallet created 'new Wallet()'
  + Each wallet is provided with public/private keys using Elliptic Curve Cryptography
- Fund Transfer:
  + Secure transfer algorithm to prove ownership before funds are sent
  + Transactions on blockchain made by 'Block.addTransaction(walletA.sendFunds(walletB.publicKey, 20));

Ongoing Development:
- Loans functionality
- Smart Contracts
- New 'credit score' like system
